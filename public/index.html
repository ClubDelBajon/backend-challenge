    <h1>Morfy - Backend Challenge</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Morfy Backend challenge! We are working on a blog backend where users can register, log in and create or read posts.
    <p>
      Your API base url is <a href="http://localhost:3000/api/">http://localhost:3000/api/</a>
    </p>
    <p>Please read the README.md carefully before starting.</p>
    <p>
      <b>Ready to start? Here we go:</b>
    </p>
    <h2>1. Authorization</h2>
    <p>
      There is a security issue: any user can create a post on behalf of another user! Can you fix it?
    </p>
    <h2>2. Get Posts</h2>
    <p>
      The existing endpoint GET
      <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts">http://localhost:3000/posts</a>
      retrieves all existing posts. Implement the following functionalities:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>2.a)</b> Get posts by author</li>
        <li><b>2.b)</b> Get posts by keyword</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>3. Comments</h2>
    <p>
      Many users are requesting the ability to comment on posts. Each comment should have an author and content.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>3.a)</b> Add a new comment to a post</li>
        <li><b>3.b)</b> Include comments when getting a post by ID</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>4. Tests</h2>
    <p>
      We need unit tests for either points 2 or 3 to improve coverage.
    </p>
    <h2>5. [Optional] Bonus Track</h2>
    <p>
      <li><b>5.a)</b> The frontend team is asking for API documentation. They suggest Swagger as a good choice. Is it already implemented?</li>
      <li><b>5.b)</b> The infrastructure team requests running the API in a Docker container, pointing to a minified build.</li>
    </p>
    </br>
    <p>Good luck with the challenge! Remember, the goal is to demonstrate your ability to identify and fix issues, implement new features, and write tests. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you get stuck. We're looking forward to seeing your solution!</p>
